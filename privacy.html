        <h2>1. Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>Frankie AI ("we", "us", or "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and the measures we take to safeguard it. By using our extension, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
        <p>We collect the email address you provide to create and manage your account. This email is stored securely (using a backend service such as Supabase) and retained until you delete your account. We do not store your Instagram messages; messages are only processed temporarily through the Gemini AI API to generate chat responses and then discarded.</p>

        <h3>Use of Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>The extension uses a secure backend service (Supabase) to store account information and manage message credits. It also uses a third-party AI service (Gemini API) to process and generate responses to your messages.

        <h3>Monetization</h3>
        <p>Frankie AI is monetized through the sale of message credits. There are no advertisements, and we do not sell or rent your personal information to anyone. All revenues come from user purchases of message credits for premium features.</p>
